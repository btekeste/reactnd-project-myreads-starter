### Overview
This project is a web-based application that manages books you are currently reading, you wish to read or you already read. My contribution was to convert the given HTML wireframe static site into a React app for interactivity.

##### My tasks:
* Create components with state management to implement each functionality for the library.
* The main page display 3 bookshelves.
* The search page contains a search bar.
* In the main page the books info are pulled from the backend server via given API. Also moving books from shelf to shelf sends an update to the server.
* The search page allows you to query for books to add to the main page library. The API accepts only a restricted number of keywords.

### Instructions
1. Clone the code from my [repository](https://github.com/btekeste/TOBECHANGED)
2. Run:
   * `npm install`
   * `npm start`

`Note:` For more details on the API usage check out the original [repo](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
