### Overview
This project is a web-based application that manages books you are currently reading, you wish to read or you already read. My contribution was to convert the given HTML wireframe static site into a React app for interactivity.

##### My tasks:
* Create components with state management to implement each functionality for the library.
* Setup the main page to display 3 bookshelves.
* Implement a search bar in the the search page.
* Ensure that in the main page the books info are pulled from the backend server via given API. Also moving books from shelf to shelf sends an update to the server.
* Allow to query for new books to add to the main page from the search page. The API accepts only a restricted number of [keywords](https://github.com/btekeste/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/SEARCH_TERMS.md).

### Instructions
1. Clone the code from my [repository](https://github.com/btekeste/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
2. Run:
   * `npm install`
   * `npm start`

`Note:` For more details on the API usage check out the original [repo](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter#backend-server)
